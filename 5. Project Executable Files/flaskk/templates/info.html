            <h1>What is <span>Liver Cirrhosis?</span></h1>
            <p>Liver cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by the gradual replacement of healthy liver tissue with scar tissue. This scarring impairs the liver's ability to function properly and can lead to liver failure, which is life-threatening. Cirrhosis is the result of long-term, continuous damage to the liver and may be caused by various factors, including:</p>

    <h2>Causes of <span>Liver Cirrhosis</span></h2>
    <br><br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chronic Alcohol Consumption</strong>: Excessive alcohol intake over many years can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Chronic Viral Hepatitis</strong>: Hepatitis B and C are viral infections that cause inflammation and damage to the liver, potentially leading to cirrhosis.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)</strong>: This condition, often associated with obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol, can cause liver damage and cirrhosis.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Autoimmune Hepatitis</strong>: A condition where the body's immune system attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and damage.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Genetic Disorders</strong>: Conditions such as hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease, which involve abnormal storage of iron and copper in the liver, respectively.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Bile Duct Diseases</strong>: Diseases that affect the bile ducts, such as primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, can lead to cirrhosis.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Symptoms of <span>Liver Cirrhosis</span></h2>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <p>In the early stages, cirrhosis may not cause any noticeable symptoms. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fatigue and weakness</li><br>
        <li>Loss of appetite and weight loss</li><br>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li><br>
        <li>Abdominal pain and swelling</li><br>
        <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li><br>
        <li>Itchy skin</li><br>
        <li>Easy bruising and bleeding</li><br>
        <li>Swelling in the legs and ankles</li><br>
        <li>Confusion and memory problems</li><br>
    </ul>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Preventive <span>Measures</span></h2>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <p>While some causes of liver cirrhosis cannot be avoided, there are several lifestyle changes and preventive measures that can help reduce the risk:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Limit Alcohol Consumption</strong>: Avoid excessive drinking and follow recommended guidelines for alcohol intake.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Maintain a Healthy Diet</strong>: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid high-fat and high-sugar foods.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Exercise Regularly</strong>: Engage in regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Avoid Risky Behaviors</strong>: Reduce the risk of hepatitis infection by avoiding sharing needles, practicing safe sex, and being cautious with tattoos and piercings.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Get Vaccinated</strong>: Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B. Speak with your healthcare provider about vaccination.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Manage Health Conditions</strong>: Control underlying conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol with the help of a healthcare provider.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Avoid Toxins</strong>: Limit exposure to harmful chemicals and toxins, such as those found in cleaning products and insecticides.</li>
    </ul><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>What <span>Not</span> to Do</h2><br><br><br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't Abuse Alcohol</strong>: Chronic heavy drinking is a major cause of liver cirrhosis. If you have difficulty controlling your alcohol intake, seek professional help.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Don't Ignore Hepatitis</strong>: If you are diagnosed with hepatitis B or C, follow your healthcare provider's treatment plan and attend regular check-ups.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Don't Ignore Unhealthy Weight</strong>: Obesity is a risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Work towards achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Don't Use Illicit Drugs</strong>: Avoid using illegal drugs and sharing needles, which can increase the risk of hepatitis and other infections.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Don't Neglect Vaccinations</strong>: Ensure you are vaccinated against hepatitis A and B to reduce your risk of infection.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Don't Ignore Medical Advice</strong>: Follow your healthcare provider’s recommendations for managing chronic conditions and medications.</li>
    </ul><br><br><br>
